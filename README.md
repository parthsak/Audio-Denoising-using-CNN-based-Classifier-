# Audio-Denoising-using-CNN-based-Classifier-

This repository is based on audio classification problem which uses machine learning approach.

The objective of this is to create a machine learning application able to classify different audio sounds. Here a well known dataset called  [UrbanSound8k Dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html) is used; which contains 10 different sounds as follows:Air conditioner, children playing, dog bark, engine idling, gun shot, drilling, jackhammer, siren, street music, car horn.

In this project Data exploration and analysis of dataset is done with different methods. Following that training and evaluation of a machine learning model is performed.
